      <h3>spiking neural network -- <a href="https://github.com/samp5/ha141">repo</a></h2>
        <p>
          i worked on this project for about a year and a half with my research supervisor <a
            href="https://rooshenas.github.io/">Pedram Rooshenas</a>. initially starting as a project to fufill <a
            href="https://honors.uic.edu/academics/requirements/">honor college requirements</a> during spring 2024, i
          really got a chance to bring this project where it is today when Professor Rooshenas invited me to continue
          full time over the summer of 2024.
          <br>
          <br>
          motivated by potential energy savings (among other things), <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiking_neural_network">spiking
            neural networks</a> take inspriation from biological neural networks, incorporating <em>time</em> into the
          model and
          propagating signals on neuron "spikes" rather than on each propagation cycle.
          <br>
          <br>
          for technical information, please see my <a href="cv.html">cv</a> for the short of it, or my <a
            href="https://github.com/samp5/ha141">github repository</a> for more details
        </p>
        <h3>connect-four -- <a href="https://github.com/samp5/connect-four">repo</a></h2>
          <p>
            i worked on this project with a good friend <a href="https://github.com/moltm3">michael oltman</a> for
            cs342: software design.
            <br> <br>
            (not to brag but to brag) micheal an i were exempted from the final exam for placing in the top three
            projects in the class!
            <br> <br>

            i encourage you to check out all the screenshots on the <a
              href="https://github.com/samp5/connect-four">respository</a> and even give it a run if you have the time.
            we put a lot of time drawing all the pixel art with the amazing open-source software <a
              href="https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite">aseprite</a> so go check it out! connect-four is a <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four#Mathematical_solution">solved game</a> so the ai is,,
            pretty hard.
          </p>
          <h3>keepTUIt -- <a href="https://github.com/samp5/keepTUI">repo</a></h2>
            <p>
              this is was my very first project in Rust and i honestly still use this nifty little note-taker almost
              every day.
              <br>
              <br>
              i used to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Keep">google keep</a> <strong>all the
                time</strong>, but hated opening my browser to quickly jot down a todo. keepTUIt is a simple little
              terminal user interface built with the amazing <a href="https://ratatui.rs/">ratatui</a> crate that lets
              you create and edit notes in a similar style to google keep.

                alt="screen shot of keep terminal user interface" />

              you can find more details and screenshots on my repository! however, you might notice that those
              screenshots have a different colorscheme and layout? did i change those things and forget to update the
              readme?
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>no!</strong> colors, layout, editor options, (and maybe even keybinds soon) are configurable via a
              <code>.toml</code> file :)
